# Shana's First Python Project

This project is my first project in Practicing Programming. The aim is twofold. First, I will collect articles using the keyword 'earthquake' from Nepali English language online news sources and save them as text files. I will then do a preliminary analysis of the text as data.

## Project Parameters
